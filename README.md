# Baselines for generative modeling of crystals

This package facilitates the generation of inorganic crystalline materials through random enumeration and ion exchange. It supports generating materials optimized for thermodynamic stability, targeting a specific electronic band gap, or achieving a desired bulk modulus. These metrics establish benchmarks for evaluating the performance of generative AI models in materials science.

A preprint describing the methods in this package can be found on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02144).

## Stability and novelty leaderboard

Below are performance metrics for select models trained on the MP-20 dataset. Note this list is not exhaustive, but rather a sampling of different model types (diffusion-based, LLMs, and variational autoencoders).

We also provide results from two template-based methods (described [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02144)) to serve as a baseline.

### Generative models
| Method | Median $\Delta E_{\mathrm{d}}$ (meV/atom) | Stability rate | Novelty rate | Novel prototype rate | Novel prototype stability rate |
|--------|:---------------------------:|:--------------:|:------------:|:--------------------:|:------------------------------:|
| [MatterGen](https://github.com/microsoft/mattergen) | 188 | 3.0% | 91.8% | 7.2% | 0% |
| [FTCP](https://github.com/PV-Lab/FTCP) | 205 | 2.0% | 38.2% | 1.8% | 0% |
| [CDVAE](https://github.com/txie-93/cdvae) | 207 | 1.8% | 96.0% | **8.2%** | 0% |
| [CrystaLLM](https://github.com/lantunes/CrystaLLM) | 442 | 2.4% | 98.2% | 1.0% | 0% |

### Template-based methods
| Method | Median $\Delta E_{\mathrm{d}}$ (meV/atom) | Stability rate | Novelty rate | Novel prototype rate | Novel prototype stability rate |
|--------|:---------------------------:|:--------------:|:------------:|:--------------------:|:------------------------------:|
| [Random](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02144) | 409 | 1.4% | **98.6%** | 0% | 0% |
| [Ion exchange](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ic102031h) | **85** | **9.2%** | 72.4% | 0% | 0% |

These results are based on a random sampling of 500 novel structures (not already present in the [Materials Project](https://next-gen.materialsproject.org/)) generated by each method.

* **Median $\Delta E_{\mathrm{d}}$**: The median [decomposition energy](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10853-022-06915-4), which measures the thermodynamic stability of a material relative to competing phases. Lower values are considered better, signifying materials closer to the hull. 
* **Stability rate**: The percentage of generated materials that are on the hull ($\Delta E_{\mathrm{d}} \leq$ 0) defined by stable entries from the Materials Project.
* **Novelty rate**: The percentage of materials generated that were not already present in the Materials Project. Only these were materials were considered when computing the stability rate and average decomposition energy.
* **Novel prototype rate**: Defined as the percentage of proposed materials whose structures cannot be indexed to a known prototype in the [AFLOW](https://www.aflowlib.org/prototype-encyclopedia/) Encyclopedia of Crystallographic Prototypes.
* **Novel prototype stability rate**: The stability rate of materials in these novel structure prototypes.

The bold text in each column denotes the best value achieved among all methods. For all metrics except Avg. $\Delta E_{\mathrm{d}}$, a higher value is considered better.

## Installation

The package can be installed as follows:

```bash
git clone https://github.umn.edu/bartel-group/matgen_baselines.git
cd matgen_baselines
python -m pip install .
```

For ML predictions of band gap and bulk modulus, the user should also install [CGCNN](https://github.com/txie-93/cgcnn). Since this package is not available on PyPI, the following procedure can be used:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/txie-93/cgcnn.git
mv cgcnn base_cgcnn # install directory
mv cgcnn_setup.py base_cgcnn/setup.py
cd base_cgcnn
python -m pip install -e .
cd ../
```

## Usage

The package supports two primary generation methods with optional ML-based filtering:

### Generation Methods

1. **Random Enumeration (`random_enum`)**
   - Generates materials by randomly combining elements with prototype structures (from [AFLOW](https://aflowlib.org/prototype-encyclopedia/))
   - The code ensures charge balance in the resulting compositions using [pymatgen](https://pymatgen.org/)
   - Can be combined with ML filtering to target specific properties
   - Best for broad exploration of chemical space

2. **Ion Exchange (`ion_exchange`)**
   - Generates materials by performing ion substitutions on known materials
   - Can directly target specific properties during generation
   - Can optionally use ML filtering for additional verification
   - Best for targeted exploration around known stable compounds

### ML Filtering

ML filtering can be applied to either generation method to:
- Predict stability using [CHGNet](https://chgnet.lbl.gov/)
- Predict band gaps using [CGCNN](https://github.com/txie-93/cgcnn)
- Predict bulk modulus using [CGCNN](https://github.com/txie-93/cgcnn)

## Configuration

Tasks are configured in a config.json file. Here are all the supported combinations with example configurations:

### 1. Basic Random Enumeration
Generate structures without any property targeting:
```json
{
    "method": "random_enum",
    "num_strucs": 500,
    "filepath": "Randomly-Enumerated"
}
```

### 2. Random Enumeration with ML Filtering

    "method": "random_enum",
    "num_strucs": 500,
    "ml_filter": {
        "type": "stability",  # or "band_gap" or "bulk_modulus"
        "threshold": 0.0,     # for stability: maximum allowed energy above hull (in eV/atom)
        "target": 3,         # for properties: desired band_gap (eV) or bulk_modulus (GPa)
        "threshold": 0.5     # for properties: allowed deviation from target
    },
    "filepath": "Random-Enum-ML-Filtered/Property"

            "filepath": "Ion-Exchanged/Bulk-Modulus"
        }
    ]
}
```

## Running Generation

Once your config.json is set up, start generation with:

```bash
python generate.py
```

Generated structures will be saved as CIF files in the specified output directories.

## Calculating Decomposition Energies

The package includes a standalone script `calc_decomp.py` for calculating decomposition energies of materials using the Materials Project database as a reference. This script processes a CSV file containing material compositions and their computed energies, calculating the energy above hull or decomposition energy for each entry.

> **⚠️ IMPORTANT: Input energies must be:**
> - In units of eV/atom
> - From GGA/GGA+U calculations (or MLPs trained on GGA/GGA+U calculations) with Materials Project corrections already applied. Energies obtained from CHGNet are directly compatible.

### Usage

1. Add your Materials Project API key to the script:
   - Open `calc_decomp.py`
   - In the `calculate_decomp_energies()` function, set the API key associated with your [Materials Project](https://materialsproject.org/api) account

2. Prepare your input CSV file with the following format:
   ```csv
   composition,energy_per_atom
   Fe3Al,-7.4878
   AlFe2,-7.0365
   ```

3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python calc_decomp.py input_file.csv
   ```

4. The script will:
   - Process each composition
   - Calculate decomposition energies using Materials Project data
   - Add results to a new 'decomp_energy' column
   - Save the updated data back to your input file

### Output Format

The script will update your input file with a new column:
```csv
composition,energy_per_atom,decomp_energy
Fe3Al,-7.4878,0.0
AlFe2,-7.0365,0.1
```

- Positive decomposition energies indicate the material is unstable
- Zero or negative values indicate the material is stable
- Values are in eV/atom

## Assessing MP Novelty

The package includes a script `assess_mp_novelty.py` for checking the novelty of crystal structures by comparing them against the Materials Project database. A structure is considered novel if either:

1. No materials with the same composition exist in MP, or
2. No materials with matching structure exist in MP for the same composition

While this does not necessarily mean the material has never been synthesized, it confirms the material is absent from the MP-20 dataset, which is commonly used to train generative models for inorganic crystals.

### Usage

1. Set your Materials Project API key:
   - Open `assess_mp_novelty.py`
   - Replace `'YOUR_API_KEY'` with your actual [Materials Project](https://materialsproject.org/api) API key in the `NoveltyAssessment` class initialization

2. Place your CIF files in a directory (default: `Structures/`)

3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python assess_mp_novelty.py
   ```

4. The script will:
   - Process all CIF files in the structures directory
   - Check each structure against the Materials Project database
   - Generate a detailed report showing novelty status for each structure
   - Save results to `novelty_results.json`
