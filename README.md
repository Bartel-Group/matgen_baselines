# Baselines for generative modeling of crystals

This package facilitates the generation of inorganic crystalline materials through random enumeration and ion exchange. It supports generating materials optimized for thermodynamic stability, targeting a specific electronic band gap, or achieving a desired bulk modulus. These metrics establish benchmarks for evaluating the performance of generative AI models in materials science.

A preprint describing the methods in this package can be found on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02144).

## Stability and novelty leaderboard

Below are performance metrics for select models trained on the MP-20 dataset. Note this list is not exhaustive, but rather a sampling of different model types (diffusion-based, LLMs, and variational autoencoders).

We also provide results from two template-based methods (described [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02144)) to serve as a baseline.

### Generative models
| Method | Avg. $\Delta E$ (meV/atom) | Stability rate | Novelty rate | Novel prototype rate | Novel prototype stability rate |
|--------|:---------------------------:|:--------------:|:------------:|:--------------------:|:------------------------------:|
| [MatterGen](https://github.com/microsoft/mattergen) | 213.2 | 3.0% | 91.8% | 9.8% | 0% |
| [FTCP](https://github.com/PV-Lab/FTCP) | 228.5 | 2.0% | 38.2% | 6.4% | 0% |
| [CDVAE](https://github.com/txie-93/cdvae) | 230.5 | 0.8% | 96.0% | **16.0%** | 0% |
| [CrystaLLM](https://github.com/lantunes/CrystaLLM) | 411.0 | 2.4% | 98.2% | 5.2% | 0% |

### Template-based methods
| Method | Avg. $\Delta E$ (meV/atom) | Stability | Novelty | Novel prototypes | Novel prototype stability |
|--------|:---------------------------:|:--------------:|:------------:|:--------------------:|:------------------------------:|
| [Random](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02144) | 388.8 | 1.4% | **98.6%** | 0% | 0% |
| [Ion exchange](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ic102031h) | **107.2** | **9.2%** | 72.4% | 0% | 0% |

These results are based on a samlping of 500 novel structures (not already present in the [Materials Project](https://next-gen.materialsproject.org/)) generated by each method.

* **Avg. $\Delta E_{\mathrm{d}}$**: The average [decomposition energy](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10853-022-06915-4), which measures the thermodynamic stability of a material relative to competing phases. Lower values are considered better, signifying materials closer to the hull. 
* **Stability**: The percentage of generated materials that are on the hull ($\Delta E_{\mathrm{d}} \leq$ 0) defined by stable entries from the Materials Project.
* **Novelty**: The percentage of materials generated that were not already present in the Materials Project. Only these were considered in computing the stability rate.
* **Novel prototypes**: Defined as the percentage of proposed materials whose structures cannot be indexed to a known prototype in the [AFLOW](https://www.aflowlib.org/prototype-encyclopedia/) Encyclopedia of Crystallographic Prototypes.
* **Novel prototype stability**: The stability rate of materials in these novel prototypes.

The bold text in each column denotes the best value achieved among all methods. For all metrics except Avg. $\Delta E_{\mathrm{d}}$, a higher value is considered better.

## Installation

The package can be installed as follows:

```bash
git clone https://github.umn.edu/bartel-group/matgen_baselines.git
cd matgen_baselines
python -m pip install .
```

For ML predictions of band gap and bulk modulus, the user should also install [CGCNN](https://github.com/txie-93/cgcnn). Since this package is not available on PyPI, the following procedure can be used:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/txie-93/cgcnn.git
mv cgcnn base_cgcnn # install directory
mv cgcnn_setup.py base_cgcnn/setup.py
cd base_cgcnn
python -m pip install -e .
cd ../
```

## Usage

The package supports two primary generation methods with optional ML-based filtering:

### Generation Methods

1. **Random Enumeration (`random_enum`)**
   - Generates materials by randomly combining elements with prototype structures (from [AFLOW](https://aflowlib.org/prototype-encyclopedia/))
   - The code ensures charge balance in the resulting compositions using [pymatgen](https://pymatgen.org/)
   - Can be combined with ML filtering to target specific properties
   - Best for broad exploration of chemical space

2. **Ion Exchange (`ion_exchange`)**
   - Generates materials by performing ion substitutions on known materials
   - Can directly target specific properties during generation
   - Can optionally use ML filtering for additional verification
   - Best for targeted exploration around known stable compounds

### ML Filtering

ML filtering can be applied to either generation method to:
- Predict stability using [CHGNet](https://chgnet.lbl.gov/)
- Predict band gaps using [CGCNN](https://github.com/txie-93/cgcnn)
- Predict bulk modulus using [CGCNN](https://github.com/txie-93/cgcnn)

## Configuration

Tasks are configured in a config.json file. Here are all the supported combinations with example configurations:

### 1. Basic Random Enumeration
Generate structures without any property targeting:
```json
{
    "method": "random_enum",
    "num_strucs": 500,
    "filepath": "Randomly-Enumerated"
}
```

### 2. Random Enumeration with ML Filtering
Generate structures and filter for stability or specific properties using ML:

```json
{
    "method": "random_enum",
    "num_strucs": 500,
    "ml_filter": {
        "type": "stability",  # or "band_gap" or "bulk_modulus"
        "threshold": 0.0,     # for stability: maximum allowed energy above hull (in eV/atom)
        "target": 3,         # for properties: desired band_gap (eV) or bulk_modulus (GPa)
        "threshold": 0.5     # for properties: allowed deviation from target
    },
    "filepath": "Random-Enum-ML-Filtered/Property"

            "filepath": "Ion-Exchanged/Bulk-Modulus"
        }
    ]
}
```

## Running Generation

Once your config.json is set up, start generation with:

```bash
python generate.py
```

Generated structures will be saved as CIF files in the specified output directories.

## Calculating Decomposition Energies

The package includes a standalone script `calc_decomp.py` for calculating decomposition energies of materials using the Materials Project database as a reference. This script processes a CSV file containing material compositions and their computed energies, calculating the energy above hull or decomposition energy for each entry.

> **⚠️ IMPORTANT: Input energies must be:**
> - In units of eV/atom
> - From GGA/GGA+U calculations (or MLPs trained on GGA/GGA+U calculations) with Materials Project corrections already applied. Energies obtained from CHGNet are directly compatible.

### Usage

1. Add your Materials Project API key to the script:
   - Open `calc_decomp.py`
   - In the `calculate_decomp_energies()` function, set the API key associated with your [Materials Project](https://materialsproject.org/api) account

2. Prepare your input CSV file with the following format:
   ```csv
   composition,energy_per_atom
   Fe3Al,-7.4878
   AlFe2,-7.0365
   ```

3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python calc_decomp.py input_file.csv
   ```

4. The script will:
   - Process each composition
   - Calculate decomposition energies using Materials Project data
   - Add results to a new 'decomp_energy' column
   - Save the updated data back to your input file

### Output Format

The script will update your input file with a new column:
```csv
composition,energy_per_atom,decomp_energy
Fe3Al,-7.4878,0.0
AlFe2,-7.0365,0.1
```

- Positive decomposition energies indicate the material is unstable
- Zero or negative values indicate the material is stable
- Values are in eV/atom
